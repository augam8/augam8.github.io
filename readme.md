### COMPONENTS:

Navbar – This is located on top of the page on the right side. Users will let them know which page they are on if they point the mouse to the text word. It is a simple navbar that can be defined on top of the page. The navbar has a hover effect on the text words. If user hovers over them the background chages colour to dark to let them know they will be on that page if clicked on.

### WIREFRAMES:
After browsing through many inspirations from various sites. I decided to stick with a minimalistic design and theme. I used a software called balsamic mockups 3 to create my wireframe. Refer to screenshot mockup;

### ACCESSIBILITY:
This website includes alt text on all images to ensure compatibility with screen readers for visually impared users. I was careful not to use high contrast colour palette.

### CONSIDERATIONS: 
There were no serious threat and ethical considerations as this project is published as open source. It is important that my web folio is accessible to anyone. I didn’t have to show my email on my site, so the contact form is really great concealing that. Using Netlify and SRI made it 
### DESIGN VARIATIONS:
There are three variations to the overall design of my website which have been deployed in my github account and can be accessed in the below links.
Githublink v1 – change-background
Github link v2 – change-font-color


### KEY CHALLENGES:
Everything was difficult, given that we have only learnt html and css in such a short  period of time and then deploy this project, it was a nightmare. There were lots of experimentation and trial and error, I watched a lot of tutorials and I tried to just replicate those. (Credits given below)  It was very tricky to get everything aligned.
The website is stil not yet fully esponsive so it may not look good in other browsers and devices because I ran out of time for this.
I would have love to experiment more with colour schemes, fonts and responsive layouts for different devices due to time constraint. The good thing now is as I learn more I can update my page and have it fully functioning with lots of different styling that I can articulate to potential clients or employers.
### SITEMAP:
My portfolio website consists of 4 pages, navigatable from the navbar or by scrolling.
